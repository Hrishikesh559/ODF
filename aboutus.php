            <h3>Our Process.</h3>

            <p>This forum is useful for the beginners to get information  related to  various topics. There is a centralized database in which all the information is managed. The administrator acts as the highest authority and has the rights to update the database. <!--There are also connected user who acts as an intermediate user who can also answer the questions of the end-user if they know it. The intermediate user can also cache the information provided by the administrator to the end-user.This cached information is useful when the same question is repeated some another user , then the intermediate user can get the information from cache memory and reply to the end-user. This reduces the response time.--></p>

The access to the database is provided to the end-user according to these rights only.--></p>
